The Builder Pattern is a creational design pattern that lets you construct complex objects step by step. It allows you to create different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.

Why Use the Builder Pattern?
Imagine you want to create a User object with many optional fields like email, phone, address, etc. Using a constructor with many parameters becomes confusing and error-prone. Builder pattern solves this problem elegantly.

Benefits
Avoids telescoping constructors (constructors with lots of parameters).
Makes the code more readable and maintainable.
Allows immutable object creation.
Flexible â€” you can create different configurations of the same object.
