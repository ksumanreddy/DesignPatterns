Problems with the singleton when usinfg simple static method : 

If two or more threads try to access a static metod at the same time , 
it will crerate multiple objects 

private static DBConnection INSTANCE = null; if we try to initiliaze 
private static DBConnection INSTANCE = new DBConnection(); , Then it will always create 
object only once , but the problem is since it is a static , it will always create an 
object when application started itself , so it might create an object when we don't need also 
Cannot pass non static dependencies
